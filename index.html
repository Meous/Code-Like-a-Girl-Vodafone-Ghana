                <h2>History of Women in Technology</h2>
                <p> Women have played a vital role in the field of computer
                    science and Information Technology, developing some of the most
                    essential components of modern IT
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating the first computer program (Ada Lovelace)</li>
                    <li>Inventing computing methods and devices, like the compiler (Grace Hopper)</li>
                    <li>Advancing human space exploration (Katherine Johnson)</li>
                    <li>Developing programs that influence how today's computers work (Margaret Hamilton)</li>
                </ul>

                <p> Ada Lovelace, considered the first computer programmer and a visionary
                    for what programming and computers could eventually become, has a 
                    technology award named after her, and a holiday devoted to celebrating
                     her legacy. Katherine Johnson meanwhile, the NASA "computer" 
                     responsible for successfully plotting the flight paths of some of 
                     America's earliest space exploration expeditions, was the subject 
                     of the Hollywood blockbuster Hidden Figures (and the book it's based on). </p>

                <h2> Why Girls Need to Learn How to Code </h2>
                <p> Coding is empowering and gives girls an equal shot. It increases their odds of having well-paid STEM jobs. Those jobs also have a potential to 
                    reduce the pay gap and boost the average womanâ€™s pay significantly. According to research conducted by the American Association of University Women,
                    male and female programmers were earning the same salary one year after graduation. </p>
